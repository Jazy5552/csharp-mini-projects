This is a collection of small C# programs that I created, mostly to learn C# and the .net framework. The most useful program would have to be the AutoClicker.

The AutoClicker has a full GUI interface and allows you to rapidly click a certain number of times. It also has some other small features such as holding down left click, as well as a hot key to cancel the clicker.
